# Content Expansion Methods

_Based on Nicolas Cole's framework from Ship 30 for 30_

Any piece of writing can be expanded in 10 ways. These are the core content sections that can transform a simple idea into comprehensive, valuable content:

## 1. Tips

**Purpose**: Provide actionable advice readers can implement immediately
**When to use**: When you want to give practical, specific guidance
**Example**: "Here are 3 ways to write better headlines..." or "Pro tip: Always outline before you write"

## 2. Stats

**Purpose**: Add credibility and concrete evidence to support your points
**When to use**: When you need to prove a point or show the magnitude of a problem/opportunity
**Example**: "73% of writers struggle with consistency" or "Companies that blog get 67% more leads"

## 3. Steps

**Purpose**: Break down complex processes into manageable, sequential actions
**When to use**: When explaining how to do something or providing a framework
**Example**: "Step 1: Identify your audience. Step 2: Choose your platform. Step 3: Create your content calendar"

## 4. Lessons

**Purpose**: Share insights gained from experience, both successes and failures
**When to use**: When you want to provide wisdom that comes from trial and error
**Example**: "The biggest lesson I learned from my first year of writing online..." or "What 100 failed articles taught me"

## 5. Benefits

**Purpose**: Explain "what's in it for the reader" - why they should care about your advice
**When to use**: Always! Benefits transform generic advice into something readers can see improving their lives
**Example**: "Outlining will cut your writing time in half and eliminate the dreaded 'what comes next?' panic"

## 6. Reasons

**Purpose**: Provide logical justification for why something works or why readers should take action
**When to use**: When you need to convince readers or explain the "why" behind your advice
**Example**: "Here are 5 reasons why short-form content outperforms long-form on social media"

## 7. Mistakes

**Purpose**: Help readers avoid common pitfalls and learn from others' errors
**When to use**: When you want to provide a "heads up" for what to look for or avoid
**Example**: "The #1 mistake new writers make is trying to be perfect from day one" or "Avoid these 3 content creation traps"

## 8. Examples

**Purpose**: Make abstract concepts concrete and relatable through specific instances
**When to use**: When explaining complex ideas or showing how principles apply in real situations
**Example**: "Take Ryan Holiday's 'The Obstacle Is The Way' - it started as a blog post called 'Stoicism 101'"

## 9. Questions

**Purpose**: Engage readers, prompt self-reflection, and guide thinking
**When to use**: To create interaction, help readers apply concepts to their situation, or transition between sections
**Example**: "Before you publish, ask yourself: 'What's the one thing I want readers to remember?'"

## 10. Personal Stories

**Purpose**: Build connection, demonstrate authenticity, and show that you've "been there"
**When to use**: When you want to establish credibility and help readers see you as a trusted source
**Example**: "I remember staring at a blank page for 3 hours, paralyzed by perfectionism..." or "Last year, I made the mistake of..."

## How to Use This Framework

**The Golden Rule**: You can use these exact words in your writing - "reasons," "mistakes," "steps," etc. - and readers will have no idea you're following a formula. They'll just think, "Wow, this is really comprehensive and well-structured."

**Balance is Key**: Don't give readers 10 reasons and only 1 action step. Aim for equal weight across sections to avoid overwhelming readers with any single ingredient.

**Start Small, Expand Proven Winners**: Use short-form content (tweets, posts) to test ideas, then expand the high-performers using these 10 methods.

**The Lean Writing Method**: This framework allows you to take a single tweet and turn it into a 300-page book by keeping the main points the same and expanding within each section using these content types.

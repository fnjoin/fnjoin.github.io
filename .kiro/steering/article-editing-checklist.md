# Article Editing Checklist

This steering document provides a systematic approach to editing and polishing blog articles. Use this when the user asks to "edit" or "polish" an article.

## Complete Editing Process

When a user asks to edit an article, perform ALL of these steps in sequence:

### 1. Content Structure Review

-   **Check headings match actual content**: Ensure section headers accurately reflect what's discussed in each section
-   **Verify AIDA framework**: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action flow
-   **Apply but/therefore rule**: Ensure sections build on each other rather than just listing points ("and then" = boring, "but/therefore" = engaging)

### 2. Voice & Tone Consistency

-   **Remove sensational phrasing**: Avoid overused phrases like "Here's the thing nobody tells you..."
-   **Maintain conversational tone**: Keep "discovery-sharing" voice, not "lecturer" tone
-   **Check for humble expertise**: Show learning process, not preaching

### 3. Grammar & Mechanics

-   **Spelling errors**: Scan for typos (e.g., "repititive" → "repetitive")
-   **Subject-verb agreement**: Check plural subjects with plural verbs
-   **Article usage**: Fix "a/an" errors (e.g., "as single" → "a single")

### 4. Tense Consistency

-   **Past tense**: For personal experiences and stories
-   **Present tense**: For current practices and general advice
-   **Check transitions**: Ensure tense shifts are logical and support narrative flow

### 5. Active Voice Conversion

Look for passive voice constructions and convert to active where it improves clarity:

-   ❌ "Whatever needed to be built was determined by the build system"
-   ✅ "The build system determines what needs to be built"
-   ❌ "Modules that were not affected by changes"
-   ✅ "Modules that changes don't affect"
-   ❌ "smart builds were incredibly helpful"
-   ✅ "I found smart builds incredibly helpful"

### 6. Memorable Language Enhancement

Add alliteration and antithesis for memorability:

**Alliteration opportunities:**

-   Replace generic words with alliterative alternatives
-   "stuff" → "catastrophes" (catching catastrophes)
-   "add up" → "stack up surprisingly"
-   "desperately needed" (emphasizes urgency)

**Antithesis opportunities:**

-   Create contrasting pairs for emphasis
-   "stopped hurting me and started helping me"
-   "didn't need building" vs "desperately needed"
-   Before/after contrasts

## Quick Reference Patterns

### Voice Patterns to Fix

-   "You should do X" → "I started doing X and here's what changed"
-   "This is the right way" → "This worked for me"
-   "Here's the thing nobody tells you" → "What I discovered was..."

### Common Grammar Fixes

-   Repetitive → repetitive
-   "as single" → "a single"
-   "changes" (plural subject) → "change" (plural verb)

### Active Voice Conversions

-   "X was done by Y" → "Y does X"
-   "X were helpful" → "I found X helpful"
-   "X was determined by Y" → "Y determines X"

### Memorable Language Additions

-   Generic nouns → specific, alliterative alternatives
-   Simple verbs → alliterative verb phrases
-   Add contrasting pairs (antithesis) for key transformations

## Editing Prompt Recognition

When the user says any of these, perform the complete editing process:

-   "edit this article"
-   "polish the writing"
-   "make it better"
-   "final draft stage"
-   "clean this up"
-   "improve the prose"

## Output Format

After completing all editing steps, provide a brief summary of changes made:

-   Grammar/spelling fixes
-   Voice improvements
-   Structure adjustments
-   Memorable language additions

Do not create separate summary documents unless explicitly requested.
